# Python String Interview Questions

1. **Reverse a String:**
   Write a function to reverse a given string. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

2. **Check Palindrome:**
   Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. For example, "radar" is a palindrome.

3. **Count Vowels and Consonants:**
   Write a function to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string. For example, in the string "hello", there are 2 vowels and 3 consonants.

4. **Anagram Check:**
   Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

5. **String Compression:**
   Write a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, your function should return the original string.

6. **String Rotation Check:**
   Write a function to check if one string is a rotation of another. For example, "abcd" is a rotation of "cdab" but not of "bcda".

7. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:**
   Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating characters in "abcabcbb" is "abc", which has a length of 3.

8. **Find All Anagrams in a String:**
   Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

9. **Word Pattern:**
   Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern. Here, "follows" means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

10. **Longest Palindromic Substring:**
    Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.


11. **Reverse a String:**
   Write a function to reverse a given string. For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".

12. **Check Palindrome:**
   Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. For example, "radar" is a palindrome.

13. **Count Vowels and Consonants:**
   Write a function to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string. For example, in the string "hello", there are 2 vowels and 3 consonants.

14. **Anagram Check:**
   Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

15. **String Compression:**
   Write a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, your function should return the original string.

16. **String Rotation Check:**
   Write a function to check if one string is a rotation of another. For example, "abcd" is a rotation of "cdab" but not of "bcda".

17. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:**
   Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating characters in "abcabcbb" is "abc", which has a length of 3.

18. **Find All Anagrams in a String:**
   Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p
